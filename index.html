                                    version of the word 'autumn', but it was in fact in widespread usage in England
                                    until relatively recently. Originally a shortening of the phrase fall of the
                                    leaf,
                                    the phrase was common in England in the 17th century. The word autumn entered
                                    English from the French automne and didn't become common usage until the 18th
                                    century.</div>

                                    year it lands on a different date, normally either September 22nd or 23rd. The
                                    equinox is when the sun is directly in line with the Earth’s celestial equator,
                                    meaning day and night are of equal length.
                                    The reason why the equinox falls on a different date each year is because the
                                    Gregorian calendar (the one used by most of the world) counts only 365 days a
                                    year,
                                    rather than the 365.25 days the Earth actually takes to orbit the sun.</div>

                                    Aging
                                    Research. The study found that 30% of US centenarians born during 1880-1895 were
                                    born in the Autumn season.
                                    One of the theories for this is because Autumn marks a change in temperature:
                                    babies
                                    born in colder months can therefore develop a greater immunity to colds and
                                    flues.
                                    Some also believe simply that cold, crisp Autumn air is good for the
                                    constitution,
                                    resulting in the child growing up with strong health, although this may simply

                                    satisfying enough for some, research has revealed that this time change actually
                                    has
                                    some health benefits.
                                    A recent study by the University of Colorado has revealed that the number of

                                    The Roman's 'dies caniculares' began towards the end of July when the star
                                    Sirius
                                    (known as the Dog Star) began to rise in the sky just before the Sun.
                                    The star was so bright that the Romans believed it gave extra heat to the sun
                                    and
                                    was responsible for hot days in summer.

                                    Taking place in Fairbanks, Alaska, the Sun is out for almost 24 hours on the

                                    The summer solstice marks the point when the Sun reaches
                                    its highest point in the sky. This is the longest day of the year and after this
                                    point, the days slowly begin to get shorter until the winter solstice which
                                    occurs
                                    around 21 December.
                                    At the same time as the Northern Hemisphere experiences the summer solstice, the
                                    Southern Hemisphere has a winter solstice marking the shortest day of the year.

                                    Have you ever been told that if it gets hot enough in the
                                    summer, you could fry an egg on a sidewalk? Well, it's true! In 2015, when it
                                    hit a
                                    scorching 44° Celsius or around 111° Fahrenheit in Perth, Australia, a man
                                    successfully fried some eggs by using the heat that had collected on the
                                    sidewalk,
                                    according to Delish. Granted, he did use a pan, which is understandable
                                    considering
                                    that he ended up eating what he'd prepared!

                                    Swimming is a classic summer pastime that can be both
                                    invigorating and relaxing. However, there are some who take their underwater

                                    to the extreme. Just take Budimir Šobat, for example. In March 2021, the

                                    freediver, who was 56 years old at the time, set a Guinness World Record after
                                    holding his breath for an incredible 24 minutes and 37.36 seconds. "While I am

                                    I am focused on is to try to hear my heartbeat," the diver said. "Once I heard
                                    it, I
                                    became calm and ready to fight the time."
